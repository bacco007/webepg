- This project runs on Next.js and uses shadcn and Tailwind 4, never use Tailwind v3
- Use TypeScript, not JavaScript
- Add appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces
- Reuse functions already in src/lib and src/utils before writing new ones
- Types should be recorded in src/types
- Components should be recorded in src/components and may be grouped into subfolders, but commonly used components should sit in src/components and not a subfolder
- Use biome of ESlint and Prettier unless otherwise noted
- Confirm your interpretation of the objective.
- Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Include comments to explain complex logic
- Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.
- No speculative changes or “while we’re here” edits.
- Keep function complexity below 15
- use the latest version of all libraries
- unless i specifically ask, do not change the header and sidebar on pages that contain these elements
- If you are proposing significant changes you need to create a backup first, I will tell you when to remove the backup
- Summarize what was changed and why.
- List every file modified and what was done in each.
- If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.
- skip linter issues relating to css ordering, I'll fix that
- Dont try to start the server, assume its running on port 3000 already
- Don't run tests yourself, you stop the server when you do this
